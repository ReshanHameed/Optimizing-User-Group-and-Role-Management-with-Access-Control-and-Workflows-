# 🧭 Optimizing User, Group, and Role Management with Access Control and Workflows

## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates how **ServiceNow** can be used to create a secure and automated **project task management system** using **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, **Flow Designer**, and **Dashboards**.  

It was developed as part of the **Naan Mudhalvan / SmartInternz Internship Program**, showcasing practical use of ServiceNow’s low-code capabilities to enhance project workflow visibility and accountability.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
In a small project team with a **Project Manager (Alice)** and a **Team Member (Bob)**, the lack of structured roles, access restrictions, and automation leads to:
- Confusion over task ownership
- Uncontrolled data access
- Difficulty tracking task progress  

This project solves these issues by implementing **role-based permissions**, **workflow automation**, and **visual reporting** within ServiceNow.

---

## 🧠 Objective
To build a **custom ServiceNow application** that:
- Defines distinct **Users**, **Groups**, and **Roles**
- Enforces **Access Controls (ACLs)** on data
- Automates **task workflows** using Flow Designer
- Displays real-time **reports and dashboards**

| Component | Tool/Feature Used |
|------------|------------------|
| Platform | ServiceNow |
| Modules | User Administration, Flow Designer, Access Control (ACL), Reporting |
| Application Scope | Custom Scoped App: `Project Task Management` |
| Roles | `x_project_manager`, `x_team_member` |
| Dashboard Tools | Reports and Performance Analytics |

## 🧩 Key Features

### 1. **User, Group, and Role Management**
- Created users: Alice (Manager) and Bob (Team Member)
- Created groups: *Project Managers*, *Team Members*
- Created roles: `x_project_manager`, `x_team_member`
- Assigned roles to groups and users for controlled access

### 2. **Custom Scoped Application**
- Application Name: **Project Task Management**
- Custom Table: `Project Task (x_scope_project_task)`
- Fields: Task Title, Description, Assigned To, Status, Created By, Due Date

### 3. **Access Control (ACL) Implementation**
- Managers: Full access (Create, Read, Write, Delete)
- Team Members: Restricted to assigned tasks only
- ACL scripts enforce security on both record and field levels

### 4. **Workflow Automation (Flow Designer)**
- Trigger: Record creation or update
- Condition: When a task is assigned
- Actions:
  - Auto-update `Status` to “Assigned”
  - Send notifications to assigned user and manager
  - Update status to “Completed” when marked done

### 5. **Reports & Dashboards**
- Pie Chart: Tasks by Status
- Bar Chart: Tasks by Assigned User
- Combined into a **Dashboard** for Project Manager

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

| Test Case | Action | Expected Result |
|------------|---------|-----------------|
| Alice creates a new task and assigns Bob | Task created; status auto-changes to Assigned | ✅ |
| Bob views assigned tasks | Only his assigned tasks visible | ✅ |
| Bob updates task status to In Progress | Allowed; Manager notified | ✅ |
| Bob tries to edit other task fields | Access Denied | ✅ |
| Alice deletes a task | Successful | ✅ |

## 📊 Outcome
- 🔒 Secure access control per user role  
- ⚙️ Automated workflow reduces manual updates  
- 📈 Dashboards give real-time project visibility  
- 🤝 Improved accountability between manager and team member
